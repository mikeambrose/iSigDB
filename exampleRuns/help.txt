Each run of the signature tool is done on the DermDB cut matrix, included here
Each run of the matrix tool is done on the full DermDB matrix, included here with its top/bottom/variance files

The command used to run each matrix is in command.txt (won't necessarily work if the directory isn't set up the same way, though)
The output heatmap is chart.pdf
The R output underlying the heatmap is in rOutput.txt



If the ordering is different in the signatures, that's not bad - just means that something changed in the python implementation and the dictionary stored them in a different order (it's arbitrary)


These were constructed based on the versions of the scripts on 8/5/15
