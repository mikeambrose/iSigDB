            Now, we take the average of all genes in <b>Sample 1</b> which exist in <b>Signature A</b>
            which gives us our rank average. In this case, those genes are <b>Gene 1</b> and
            <b>Gene 2</b>, so the value of (<b>Sample 1</b>, <b>Signature A</b>) is <b>1.5</b>. We can also compute
            the values for the other samples and find that they are <b>1.5</b> and <b>2.5</b>, respectively.
            This gives us the
            intuition that <b>Sample 3</b> is the closest match with <b>Signature A</b>.

            <b>Rank Delta</b> computes the change in rank across multiple signatures by subtracting the mean rank
            from the rank within the sample. This is especially useful if you're trying to look at the difference
            between samples but not so useful if you're trying to compare between signatures.

            Selecting <b>Scale heatmap</b> will replace each value in the heatmap with it's z-score (taken across
            the entire matrix). Unselecting <b>Scale heatmap</b> will instead display the values themselves,
            which depend on which heatmap computation option you selected.

        <div id="vert" class="tab-content">
            Selecting <b>Signatures on vertical axis</b> will place the signatures on the vertical axis.
            This is useful if you have a higher number of selected signatures than you do samples. If you have
            more samples than signatures selected or prefer the other orientation, uncheck this.
        </div>
        <div id="colors" class="tab-content">
            Selecting <b>Dynamically choose colors</b> will re-scale the color values to match your input.
            This is helpful to see smaller changes in your output. However, if you wish to compare the heatmaps
            of multiple runs of this tool, it is better to uncheck this so that the color scales will be consistent.
        </div>
        <div id="clustering" class="tab-content">
            <b>Clustering</b> reorders the input samples and signatures according to the metric chosen.
            Clustering is always done after the scaling and computation and so will depend on the
            options chosen.

            All cell lines and tissues were sourced from 8-10 week old male C57Bl/6 mice, with the exception of female-specific organs, which were sourced from female mice. All procedures were carried out in accordance with local guidelines for animal research. For female tissues, material was pooled from three females, and for each female, on average four embryos resulting in four umbilical cords and placentas were obtained. For other tissues, material was derived from a pool of three males. Biological replicates were defined as independent RNA preparations from independent pools of mice. Technical replicates were defined as independent amplifications from the sample RNA sample.
